         "While gay rights and marriage equality has been embraced by most countries  a small town in Southern India lives within a cocoon of traditions and social morality. In such a milieu when a young gay man Kartik  comes out to his mother Vasudha  her entire world comes crashing down. She has no one to turn to dispel her fears and doubts  to understand her loving son's truth. Moreover as a woman  trapped within a patriarchal conservative society  her biggest challenge is to deal with her dogmatic husband Damodar  and the conservative society around her. 'Evening Shadows' is a universal story about a mother-son bonding and its emotional strength to withstand the ravages of time and harsh realities.",
         "Under the 'Evening Shadows'  truth often plays hide and seek. Set in South India and Mumbai  'Evening Shadows' is a tender heartwarming story about a mother-son bond that has to withstand the ravages of time  distance and truths.",

The son of a driver  his parents worked hard to get him educated so that he could have a white collar job. Meanwhile  Murad realizes his calling to be a rapper. Authentic Hip Hop in India is a recent phenomenon and like anywhere else in the world  is rising from the streets. Art is a distant dream for the colonized poor of India and this story is about Murad's journey from realizing his love for rap and chasing his dream to inadvertently transcending his class.
